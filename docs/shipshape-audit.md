## Needs judgement (not scored)

- README: follow it literally on a clean checkout; does a newcomer reach a running app and a green test run?
- Tests: open 3-5 tests; do they assert behaviour (outputs, state, HTTP responses) rather than only that code runs?
- CI: is the default branch actually green? (`gh run list --branch <default> --limit 10`, `gh run view <id> --log-failed`)
- Branch protection: is the aggregate CI check required and are force-pushes blocked? (`gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/<default>/protection`)
- Docs currency: do documented commands, paths and versions still exist? Is anything contradicted by the code?
- Security settings: are secret scanning, push protection, Dependabot alerts and CodeQL default setup enabled in repository settings?
- Agent instructions: do they match reality (commands work, boundaries sensible) and stay concise?
